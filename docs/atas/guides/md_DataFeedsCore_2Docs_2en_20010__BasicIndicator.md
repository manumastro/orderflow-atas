# Development of a user indicator

Source: https://docs.atas.net/en/md_DataFeedsCore_2Docs_2en_20010__BasicIndicator.html

# Basics

In order to develop a user indicator, it is necessary:

- To create a class library project in Visual Studio.

- To add a link to `ATAS.Indicators.dll`, which is in the folder with the installed program, in the project.

- Redefine the Indicator class.

- Add the necessary DataSeries - [ValueDataSeries](../api/classes/classATAS_1_1Indicators_1_1ValueDataSeries.md), [RangeDataSeries](../api/classes/classATAS_1_1Indicators_1_1RangeDataSeries.md), [CandleDataSeries](../api/classes/classATAS_1_1Indicators_1_1CandleDataSeries.md), [CandlePartSeries](../api/classes/classATAS_1_1Indicators_1_1CandlePartSeries.md), [IndicatorSeries](../api/classes/classATAS_1_1Indicators_1_1IndicatorSeries.md), [PriceSelectionDataSeries](../api/classes/classATAS_1_1Indicators_1_1PriceSelectionDataSeries.md), [PaintbarsDataSeries](../api/classes/classATAS_1_1Indicators_1_1PaintbarsDataSeries.md) or [ObjectDataSeries](../api/classes/classATAS_1_1Indicators_1_1ObjectDataSeries.md) - in the constructor.

- Describe the logic of the indicator operation in the [OnCalculate()](../api/classes/classATAS_1_1Indicators_1_1BaseIndicator.md#a65c50fc1fec7d6c490aa23a1c3eeebd3) function.

- Compile the library.

- Place the resulting dll file in the [indicators folder](./md_DataFeedsCore_2Docs_2en_20010__BasicIndicator.md#installing_the_library).

You can get examples from our GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/AtasPlatform/Indicators/). You need to add the current version of ATAS.Indicators.dll in the `references` of this project.

# Example of the indicator development

Create a class library project in Visual Studio.

First, you need to install Microsoft Visual Studio, a development environment designed for working with the `C#` language, including creating various products such as `DLL` libraries. It is in this format that you can connect your own algorithms to ATAS. The free version of Visual Studio Community can be downloaded from the official website: [visualstudio.microsoft.com//downloads/](http://visualstudio.microsoft.com//downloads/). Installation is standard, as for any other program. After installation, launch Visual Studio, select `Create a new project` and then `Create Class Library (.NET)`.

Create a new project

 Select the name `Custom Indicator` for the project and its location in the file system.

Select the name

 Select the supported version of the framework, in this case it is `.NET 8.0`. Click `Create`.

Select framework

 When start Visual Studio, it will automatically create an empty class library template.

Empty tamplate

 Main interface elements:

- Solution Explorer - located on the right (1). It displays the project structure and all its files. If the window is not visible, you can open it via the `View` menu. Other windows are available in this section, which can be enabled or hidden.

- Code editor - occupies the central area. Here you edit the source code, for example, the `Class1.cs` file.

- `namespace Custom_Indicator`(2) is a namespace that groups code into a logical area, preventing name conflicts between different parts of the program.

- `public class Class1` (3) — declaration of a class that is the basis of any `C#` project. This class will be the basis for our indicator.

Add a link to ATAS.Indicators.dll, which is in the folder with the installed program, in the project.

Links to third-party libraries are added to expand the functionality of the project without having to write code from scratch. These libraries may contain ready-made solutions for working with databases, data processing, network interaction, graphical interface and other tasks. By connecting them, the developer saves time, uses proven code and simplifies project support.

Adding a reference to `ATAS.Indicators.dll` is necessary to gain access to the base classes and API used to develop custom indicators in the ATAS platform. This library provides the necessary methods and structures for working with prices, clusters, data from other indicators and their visualization on the chart. Without this reference, the project will not be able to interact with ATAS, and the indicator code will not compile.

To add references to the `ATAS.Indicators.dll` library, right-click on the `Dependencies` line and select `Add Project Reference..`.

Add Project Reference

 In the link manager window, click the `Browse` button.

click the Browse button

 Go to the location of the ATAS platform and select the `ATAS.Indicators.dll` file. In this case it will look like this:

Location of ATAS.Indicators.dll

 Now the `ATAS.Indicators.dll` library appears in the list of added libraries.

Added Reference

 The `Indicator` class exposes a range of functionality to its derived classes, including access to price data, cluster information, results from other indicators, and additional advanced features.

Redefine the Indicator class.

Let's give our indicator the desired name `MyCustomIndicator`, inherit from the `Indicator` class, which became available to us after adding a link to `ATAS.Indicators.dll`, and at the top we need to add the line `using [ATAS.Indicators](../api/namespaces/namespaceATAS_1_1Indicators.md);` - this is a link to the library we added.

After we inherited our class from the `Indicator` class, we got a red underline indicating a compilation error.

Hovering over the red underline reveals a tooltip indicating that our class must implement the abstract `OnCalculate` method defined in the `Indicator` base class.

Inherit from Indicator class

 By clicking on this hint, the studio generates the method we need.

OnCalculate method

 The line `throw new NotImplementedException();` in the method is added by the method generator to cause an error if you forget to implement this method, it is a kind of reminder. To prevent the error from bothering us, we need to delete this entry.

Mandatory OnCalculate method and possible errors

In object-oriented programming, a method is a set of instructions that define the behavior of an object. In the `Indicator` base class, the `OnCalculate` method is declared as mandatory for overriding. This means that when adding a custom indicator to a chart, the trading platform will call the code placed inside the curly braces of the method.

The absence of the `OnCalculate` method will result in a compilation error - Visual Studio will not allow the DLL file to be built, since this method is required for correct interaction with ATAS. If the code is written correctly, the message `No issues found` will appear at the bottom of the Visual Studio interface. Otherwise, compilation errors will be displayed that need to be analyzed and corrected.

Possible causes of errors

- Case sensitivity - C# distinguishes between uppercase and lowercase letters (`OnCalculate` and `oncalculate` are different identifiers).

- Syntax errors - missing or incorrect use of curly braces `{}`, semicolons `;`, quotation marks `""` and other symbols.

- Code structure errors - for example, a violation of the `OnCalculate` method signature, which means it will not be recognized by the platform.

Visual Studio automatically analyzes your code and provides hints, allowing you to quickly find and fix errors.

The `OnCalculate` method is called by the platform on each historical bar, and when it comes to the current bar - then at each change in the current price of this instrument, i.e. at each tick. The main calculations will occur in this method.

To build the project, right-click it in the Solution Explorer and choose  `Build`.

Build a project

 Finally, the Output window should display a message confirming that the code was successfully compiled into a file.

The build was a success

 The compiled `Custom Indicator.dll` indicator file will be located at the following path: `D:\Custom Indicator\Custom Indicator\bin\Debug\net8.0`.

Location of Custom Indicator.dll

 This file needs to be placed in the [indicators folder](./md_DataFeedsCore_2Docs_2en_20010__BasicIndicator.md#installing_the_library).

Now you can add `MyCustomIndicator` to the chart, to do this, open the indicator settings, find the desired one and click on the `Add` button.

Adding MyCustomIndicator

 Nothing changed on the chart after this, because no logic was added to the indicator.

If you place the mouse cursor in the left area of ​​the chart, you can see the name of our indicator in the list of loaded indicators in the upper left corner. When you hover over the inscription itself, the indicator control buttons will appear next to the inscription: open settings (1), hide/show (2), delete the indicator (3).

Indicators legend

 Adding logging

For a simple example, you can add logging capability to `MyCustomIndicator`.

Logging is writing a particular action or state of something to a log file. Logs can be used to determine the behavior of an indicator or the entire platform. Error and warning messages can be found there. Log files are stored in the `…/ATAS/Logs` folder next to the indicator folder.

To add the logging capability, you need to add a link to the `Utils.Common.dll` library, which is located in the same place as `ATAS.Indicators.dll`. (see above).

Once you add the reference, it will appear in the list of libraries in the right window of Visual Studio as shown in the screenshot below.

To record in the log, you need to use one of the following extension methods for the indicator, defined in the connected library `Utils.Common.dll`: `LogInfo`, `LogWarn`. Since these are extension methods, they need to be called using the following entry: `this.LogInfo("message")`. To record information, it is enough to call the `LogInfo` method. If you need to emphasize the importance of the information, you can use the `LogWarn` method, in which case the text in the log window will be highlighted in yellow.

It is also important to determine the location of the logging method call. If you call this method simply in the `OnCalculate` method without limiting the conditions, then the log entry will occur on every tick and this can spam the entire file. You need to carefully select the conditions for writing logs.

For a simple demonstration, you can override the indicator's `OnInitialize` method and write a log entry there. This method is called once when the indicator is initialized, so there won't be a lot of entries. You should also add `using Utils.Common.Logging;` at the top of the file.

Adding logging

 To check the result of changing our indicator, we need to rebuild the project again and place the newly built `Custom Indicator.dll` in the [folder with indicators](./md_DataFeedsCore_2Docs_2en_20010__BasicIndicator.md#installing_the_library).

To open the logs tab, click the `Logs` button in the top toolbar. In the logs tab, you can see the entry we defined in the `OnInitialize` method: Message from OnInitialize!.

Writing to logs

 Using DataSeries

Data series are data arrays used by the indicator. Each array element corresponds to a specific candle. Candle numbering, and therefore data series elements, starts with 0. The number of candles on the chart is stored in the `CurrentBar` property and with the appearance of a new candle this value increases. If, for example, 100 candles are loaded on the chart, then the first will have the number 0, the second - number 1, the third - number 2, ... the last - number 99, and the `CurrentBar` will have the value 100.

It is important to remember the array numbering rules, because when accessing an array element by an index that the array does not have, for example a negative index or an index whose value is greater than the index of the last element, an exception will be thrown, after which the calculations are interrupted in this method. In our example, if 100 candles are loaded and we access candle number 100, an exception will be thrown, because the number of the last candle is 99.

ValueDataSeries

By default, the `MyCustomIndicator` indicator already has one data series of the `ValueDataSeries` type when created. This is a solid red line with a thickness of 1 pixel. Since we have not yet filled it with data, the elements of this data series have zero values, but its settings can be seen in the indicator settings window. In order to open the settings of the desired indicator, you can hover over it in the list of indicators in the upper left corner and click on the `settings` button (1). In the right part of the settings window, there are settings for this indicator and specifically the settings for the data series (2). When you click on a certain field, a description of this field will be displayed at the bottom (3).

DataSeries settings

 For a simple example of using a data series, we will display a line that connects candles on a chart by closing price. To do this, in the `MyCustomIndicator.cs` file, we will write the indicator constructor (1), find the default data series in the list of data series in the `DataSeries` property (it will be the first, therefore under index 0) and name it `data` (2).

Since `DataSeries` stores objects of the [IDataSeries](../api/interfaces/interfaceATAS_1_1Indicators_1_1IDataSeries.md) type, it is necessary to explicitly cast it to the ValueDataSeries type using the entry `DataSeries[0] as ValueDataSeries`. Let’s access this data series in the constructor and set its color (3) and display type - line (4).

Set DataSeries settings

 Now you can see that when we access the color of the data series, the `Color` property is underlined in red, indicating a compilation error. To remove it, you need to connect the `PresentationCore.dll` library. This can be done in several ways, and the easiest is:

- open the project file of our indicator `Custom Indicator.csproj` by double-clicking on it (1),

- in the opened file (2), change the line with `TargetFramework` (3),

- add the line `true` (4),

- click the save button (5),

- in the right window of the studio, the WPF framework will be added to the `Frameworks` list (6).

After that, properties of the `Color` type will be available.

Adding PresentationCore

 In the `MyCustomIndicator.cs` file, add `using System.Windows.Media;` at the top and the compilation errors will disappear.

In the `OnCalculate` method, we get the default data series and assign the value (by default, this is the candle closing price) obtained from the parameters to the element with the bar index. Now you don't have to worry about the correct index value, because the bar value received from the parameters will always be correct.

Again, you need to compile the project and place the finished `Custom Indicator.dll` library in the [folder with indicators](./md_DataFeedsCore_2Docs_2en_20010__BasicIndicator.md#installing_the_library).

As a result, a line with the orange color we specified will appear on the chart, connecting the candles at the closing price.

Drawing orange line

 By default, the OnCalculate method receives the candle closing price in the value parameter. This parameter can be changed by clicking on the three dots in the Source field in the indicator settings window. In the window that appears, you can select:

- candle opening price,

- maximum price,

- minimum price,

- volume value in the candle,

- average price calculated in one of the following ways:
HL2 - average price between maximum and minimum,

- HLC3 - average price between maximum, minimum and closing price,

- OHLC4 - average price between opening price, maximum, minimum and closing price,

- HLCC4 - average price between closing price of the previous candle, maximum, minimum and closing price of the current candle.

Changing source type

 The `Panel` field allows you to select where the indicator data series will be displayed. If the Chart setting is selected in this field, the data series will be displayed on the chart itself, as in the previous example. If you select `NewPanel`, the displayed data series will move to the bottom panel of the chart.

New panel selected

 Working with candle data

To work with candle data, you need to get a specific candle and extract data from it.

The main data are:

- opening, closing, maximum, minimum prices,

- Ask volume, Bid volume, total volume, delta (difference between Ask and Bid),

- maximum volume price, maximum volume value.

To get data on a specific candle, you need to use the `GetCandle(bar)` indicator method and pass the bar index to the parameters. You should also remember that this method only accepts a valid index, i.e. positive and no greater than the last bar index. If you pass an invalid index to this method, an exception will be thrown. The last bar index will always be equal to `CurrentBar-1`.

Now we will implement an indicator that will receive candle data such as the maximum price and minimum price of the candle and display this data on the chart as two lines. For this, we will need two data series of the `ValueDataSeries` type. We have one from the previous example. The other one needs to be added. In order to more conveniently access the data series, we can place the default one, which is in the indicator, in a separate field called `_highData` (1). It will display the maximum prices. Let's give it the name `High`. It will be displayed when you hover over this line on the chart. We will leave the settings the same. For the second line, we need to create another field of the `ValueDataSeries` type, let's call it `_lowData` (2). It will display the minimum prices. The declared field needs to be initialized, i.e. assign a value to it using the entry private readonly `ValueDataSeries _lowData = new("Low");` Using the keyword `new`, an object of the `ValueDataSeries` type will be created. The parameter must be a unique (within the given indicator) data series ID, which will also serve as the name. In this case, it is `Low`.

In order for a new data series to be displayed on the chart, you need to add it to the indicator data series collection (3) in the constructor.

In the `OnCalculate` method, we will fill it with data. To do this, we will create a candle variable and place the candle obtained using the `GetCandle` method in it, passing the index of the current bar (4). Below, in the `_highData` data series element with the bar index, we will place the maximum price, and in the same `_lowData` data series element - the minimum price (5).

High and low dataSeries in code

 Again, you need to compile the project and place the finished `Custom Indicator.dll` library in the [folder with indicators](./md_DataFeedsCore_2Docs_2en_20010__BasicIndicator.md#installing_the_library).

As a result, the chart will display 2 lines connecting the prices of the maximum and minimum candlesticks. In the indicator settings window, two groups of settings will appear with the names of our data series High and Low, by expanding which you can access the data series settings.

High and low dataSeries on the chart

 Custom indicator settings

It is possible to display the indicator settings defined by the user. For example, you can hide the settings of existing data series and display only the line color settings for the user. To hide a group of data series fields in the settings window, you need to set the `IsHidden` property to true (1).

To display the settings we need, we need to set them as public properties. In the getter, they will take values ​​from the data series, and in the setter, the obtained values ​​will need to be assigned to the corresponding properties of the data series. Let's define public properties with the `Color` type to set the color of the data series. Let's call them `HighDataColor` (2) and `LowDataColor` (3).

Color properties in code

 After these actions, the indicator settings window will hide the data series property groups and add new properties: `HighDataColor` and `LowDataColor`. Clicking on one of these fields will open a window with the choice of the desired color. The selected color will be applied to this line.

Color properties on the chart

 The names `HighDataColor` and `LowDataColor` are suitable for use in code, but they may not be very user-friendly. To provide more understandable names for custom properties, you can use the `Display` attribute.

To do this, simply add the `[Display]` attribute above the relevant property and specify the desired name in its string property Name, for example, `High data color` and `Low data color`. To use this attribute, you need to add the entry `using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;` at the top of the file, where all the using entries are located.

Additionally, you can group these properties by specifying a group name using the `GroupName = “Settings”` property. Properties with the same `GroupName` will be grouped together.

Display attribute in code

 Again, you need to compile the project and place the finished `Custom Indicator.dll` library in the [folder with indicators](./md_DataFeedsCore_2Docs_2en_20010__BasicIndicator.md#installing_the_library).

Now the settings contain clear names of properties and the desired group name for them.

# Installing the library into the indicators folder

After updating the indicator settings window in the ATAS platform, the method for installing user libraries has changed. In new versions, you can use both the updated and the classic (old) method.

To select the appropriate method, determine your platform version - it is displayed in the lower right corner of the main window.

Platform version

- Old version: all versions up to and including: Latest 7.0.7.331, Stable 7.0.1.449, Beta 7.0.9.215.

- New version: all versions after the above.

Depending on your version, use the appropriate instruction below.

Old version:

- copy your library with the indicator,

- paste it into the folder `C:\Users\\Documents\[ATAS](../api/namespaces/namespaceATAS.md)\Indicators`.

After adding the file, a flashing button will appear on the bottom panel of the platform, indicating that the list of indicators is being updated. The developed indicator will appear in the list of platform indicators after clicking this button.

Update the list of indicators

 New version:

- open indicator settings,

- click on the button in the lower left corner `Add custom indicator`,

- find the required library in the opened file explorer,

- click OK.

Adding a library in the new indicators window

 After this, the library with the indicator will be placed in the desired folder.

If you want to use the old method of adding, you need to take into account that the folder with indicators is located in `C:\Users\\AppData\Roaming\[ATAS](../api/namespaces/namespaceATAS.md)\Indicators`.
